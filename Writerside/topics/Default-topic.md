# Welcome to Writerside!

## Images everywhere
You can use markdown image links for all images in the project.  

![Create new topic options](external-images/super-splash.png)

There is additional simplified syntax for images in the designated images 
folder inside every documentation module.
Here, images may be referred only by their simple names.   

<img src="splash-2.png" alt="Another nice splash screen using simplified path syntax"/> 

This is only an option, the standard links to these images should also work:

<img src="Writerside/images/splash-2.png" alt="Same image, using standard path"/>

## Kotlin runnable snippets 

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```
{kotlin-runnable="true" kotlin-min-compiler-version="1.3"}
