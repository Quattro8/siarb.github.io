Frontmatter refers to the material that appears at the beginning of a book, thesis, report, or any other type of document. It includes information that introduces the document and provides context for the reader.

Typically, frontmatter includes the following elements:

* Title page: This page contains the title of the document, the author's name, and any other pertinent information, such as the publisher or date of publication.
* Copyright page: This page contains copyright information, including the copyright owner's name, the year of publication, and any relevant copyright notices.
* Table of contents: This is a list of the document's chapters or sections, along with the page numbers where they can be found.
* Preface or introduction: This is a brief statement by the author or editor that explains the purpose and scope of the document.
* Acknowledgments: This section provides an opportunity for the author to acknowledge individuals or organizations that provided assistance or support during the creation of the document.
* Foreword: This is an introductory statement written by someone other than the author that provides context or background information about the document.

Frontmatter serves as a guide for readers, providing them with an overview of the document's contents and helping them to navigate the text. It also provides important information about the author, publisher, and copyright ownership, which can be useful for citation and attribution purposes.
