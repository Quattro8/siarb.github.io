Ui-path inside tldr in chapter.

<tldr id="chapter-tldr">

</tldr>

Text after tldr.

<tldr id="tldr-second">
Second tldr for chapter must be invisible.

Does not matter where you put it, it should go to the top (and no more than 1 block).

This topic-wide tldr must be invisible.
This should be topic's tldr.
But there is no possibility in markdown to set tldr at the bottom of a topic.
